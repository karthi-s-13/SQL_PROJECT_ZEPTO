# SQL_PROJECT_ZEPTO
## DESCRIPTION:
SQL_PROJECT_ZEPTO is a data analytics project that demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract, transform, and analyze real-world business data inspired by Zepto, a hyperlocal grocery delivery startup.

This project utilizes PostgreSQL for data querying and Google Colab for data visualization, leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn to present insights visually. It aims to mimic real-world reporting scenarios like customer behavior, product trends, and operational metrics.

## TECH STACK:
Database: PostgreSQL

Visualization: Google Colab, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Language: SQL, Python

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Analytical Insights
This section highlights the core data analysis performed using SQL for querying and Python (Colab) for visualization.
To analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance based on Zepto-style delivery data.

### 1. Data Overview
Brief summary of your dataset:

-> Tables Column: s_no, category, mrp, discountPercent, availableQuantity, discountSellingPrice, weightInGms, outOfStock, quantity.

-> Total Rows: e.g., orders: 3,732 rows

-> Key Columns: s_no, category, name, mrp, discountedSellingPrice

###  2. Table Creation in PostgreSQL
The raw data (CSV files) were first imported and structured into PostgreSQL using appropriate data types and constraints.

```
create table zepto(
	s_no SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	Category VARCHAR(150),
	name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
	mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
	discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
	availableQuantity INTEGER,
	discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
	weightInGms INTEGER,
	outOfStock BOOLEAN,
	quantity INTEGER
);
```



### 3. Data Cleaning Process
Before performing analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency.

#### Checking Null values
```
select * from zepto
where category is null
	or name is null
	or mrp is null
	or discountpercent is null
	or availablequantity is null
	or discountedsellingprice is null
	or weightingms is null
	or outofstock is null
	or quantity is null;
```

#### Check specifically price might be zero or not
```
select name,mrp,discountedsellingprice
from zepto
where mrp = 0 or discountedsellingprice = 0;
```
if present -> Delete the row
```
delete from zepto
where mrp = 0 or discountedsellingprice =0;
```

#### Converting price into Rupees
```
update zepto
set mrp = mrp/100.0,
discountedsellingprice = discountedsellingprice/100.0;
```

### 4. Data Analysis
This section focuses on analyzing business data extracted from PostgreSQL using SQL and visualized in Google Colab with Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and actionable insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and operational efficiency â€” simulating a real-world scenario similar to Zepto's fast-paced delivery model.

#### 1. List out the category
```
select distinct category
from zepto
order by category;
```

#### 2. Product In Stock Vs Out of Stock
```
select outofstock,count(s_no)    -- false means "In Stock"
from zepto						 -- true means "Out of Stock"
group by outofstock;
```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured data from a real-world business model like Zepto can be analyzed using PostgreSQL for querying and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for visualization. Through SQL-based analysis and visual exploration, we uncovered key insights about customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.

The findings provide actionable insights that could help a delivery-based business optimize operations, improve customer targeting, and boost overall efficiency. The combination of clean data design, efficient queries, and compelling visualizations makes this a well-rounded data analytics project.
